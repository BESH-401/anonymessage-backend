### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
- Message the slack channel to identify whenever you are going to be working on a section of the code / project.
  - This allows us to be able to work together on parts we might want more exposure to.

## Conflict

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
#### 3-step process
  1. Prepare for Resolution by Listing the Facts & Assumptions while choosing a position on the subject.
  2. Acknowledgement, Compromise, Agreement by Vote. Upon group split, 3rd party opinion to resolve.
  3. If step 3 cannot be reached, then bring in instructor as "third party".

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- We will use the three-step process to address the issue.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Using slack to communicate what we are working on, others can ask to pair program for a better understanding overall.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Daily accountability
- Communication

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- We will use the three-step process, so this shouldn't ever be an issue.

## Communication

### What hours will you be available to communicate?
- 9AM - 6PM (if we are behind keep working past 6)

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack, Notion.so, Remo, GitHub

### How often will you take breaks?
- Depends on when and who is working on what.
  - We will not all be working together 100% of the time, so breaks are up to the individual.

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- Work more, pair program more. If we fall really far behind -> Talk to Jacob about potentially revising the MVP.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Slack

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- Daily standups. One in the morning at 9AM to discuss tasks of the day. One more at 5PM for a 'merge party' and syncing up code.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- "Keep it casual."

## Work plan

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- We will use `Notion.so` where we can assign, and identify tasks. We can use this to mark a task as 'complete'. 
  - We will also use Slack to communicate with the other members to let them know when a task is completed.

### What project management tool will be used?
- `Notion.so`, `Slack`, and `InvisionApp`

## Git Process

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- `main` branch will be the daily 'saves' of our project.
- `stage` branch will be the middleman between our individual implementations and the main.
- We will create a new branch for each implementation we create.

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- Add them to the organization.

### What is your Git flow?
- When we have a new feature:
  1. Create a new branch with naming convention `Name_implementation`
  2. On GitHub, send a merge request from branch: `Name_implementation` to `stage`
  3. At the end of each day, send a merge request from `stage` to `main`

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
- Yes

### How many people must review a PR?
- 1 for each individual branch to `stage`
- 4 for each push from `stage` to `main`

### Who merges PRs?
- The person to do the last review will merge the PR.

### How often will you merge?
- Individual implementations will be sooner than the daily `stage` to `main`

### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
- We will slack message eachother to meetup for the daily merge, and any individual branches that need to be merged.
