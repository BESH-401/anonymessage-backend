## AnonyMessage
  - An anonymous messaging web application to interact with anyone, anywhere!

## Pain points this solves:
  - Lonliness, people can use this application to connect with others
  - Ability to 'save' chat for a more convenient way of remembering messages
  - Safety is assured with the anonymity of each user in the chat

## MVP:
  - Chat to view real-time communication between 2+ clients
  - A 'save chat' feature to save the list of messages
  - A queue-type feature to relay messages to a specific user if they have been mentioned when they log back into the app

## Stretch goals:
  - Authentication
  - Gifs
  - Bot (help commands)
